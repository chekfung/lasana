Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `timeSweep'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X1.v_ca) = -5.91223 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X1.M16:dbnode) = 1.5 V
I: I(Vdd:p) = 449.2 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.
