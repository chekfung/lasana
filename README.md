Large-Scale Surrogate Modeling for Analog Neuromorphic Architecture Exploration

## A Brief Description of the Artifact

## Installation

## Running the Artifact and Comparing Results in the Paper

## Claims and experiments of the artifact

## Using the Artifact for other things?
 - After training the models, how to use the actual models to do things and simulate things
 - Basically, I think we can just point them to the scripts for batch transient analysis
 - as well as the scripts for the mnist stuff?

 - We also provide all the scripts to generate everything.

How to install the artifact, how to run the artifact, and how to compare the output of the artifact with the outputs described in the paper

A clear listing of claims that are described in the paper, along with an explanation of how each of those claims is supported by the artifact

Step-by-step instructions to execute the artifact

Instructions for reviewers to “play” with the artifact, allowing reviewers to construct new input data to test the artifact's robustness
